        <b>Tennis</b> is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). 
        <u><i>Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball</i></u> covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 
        The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
