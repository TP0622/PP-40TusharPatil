    <hr>
    <p><b>Olympic weightlifting</b>, or Olympic-style weightlifting (officially named Weightlifting), is a sport in which athletes compete in lifting a barbell loaded with weight plates from the ground to overhead, with each athlete vying to successfully lift the heaviest weights. 
    Athletes compete in two specific ways of lifting the barbell overhead: these are the snatch and the clean and jerk. 
    The snatch is a wide-grip lift, in which the weighted barbell is lifted overhead in one motion. 
    The clean and jerk is a combination lift, in which the weight is first taken from the ground to the front of the shoulders (the clean), 
    and then from the shoulders to overhead (the jerk). The clean and press, wherein a clean was followed by an overhead press, 
    was formerly also a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form.</p>
