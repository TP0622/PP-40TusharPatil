    <h1>Badminton</h1>
    <h4>aka Poona</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Badminton</b> is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams,
    the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" <i>(with two players per side).</i>
    Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. 
    Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia,<sub>[a]</sub> but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate
    officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. 
    ("Battledore" was an older term for "racquet".)[4] Its exact origin remains obscure.
    The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire,[5] but why or when remains unclear.
    As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore â€“
    A New Game, but no copy is known to have survived.[6] An 1863 article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".<sup>[7]</sup></sup></p>
